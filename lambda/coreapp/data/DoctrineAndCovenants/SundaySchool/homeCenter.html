<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Welcome to the Doctrine and Covenants<img alt="" src="data/Images/BomPlates.jpg" style="float:right; height:100px; margin:10px; width:185px" /></strong></p>

<p>This section of the website is designed to assist teachers and individuals in their personal study of the gospel of Jesus Christ. &nbsp;The format is based upon the standard lessons for the <strong>Doctrine and Covenants</strong> Gospel Doctrine class, as far as the basic area of study. &nbsp;I&#39;ve tried to provide additional insights and commentary on the meaning of the scriptures as taught by the writer.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Some of my goals for having this section of the website is to strengthen individuals faith in the Doctrine and Covenants as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Another Testimony of Jesus Christ</li>
	<li>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Please <a href="mailto:webmaster@ldsgospeldoctrine.info">contact me</a> if you find any issues/errors with what is being taught. &nbsp;It should always be sourced with where the information came from to help you in your understanding of why it is being taught.<br />
<br />

<strong>What is Mormon Doctrine and how is it to be determined?<br />
Mormon Newsroom - <a href="http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/commentary/approaching-mormon-doctrine" target="_blank">article 4 May 2007</a></strong></p>

<p>Not every statement made by a Church leader, past or present, necessarily constitutes doctrine.&nbsp;<br />
Some doctrines are more important than others and might be considered core doctrines.<br />
The mistake that public commentators often make is taking an obscure teaching that is peripheral to the Church&rsquo;s purpose and placing it at the very center.<br />
<br />
<strong>Joseph Fielding Smith clarifies how members need to compare what church leaders teach to the standard works:</strong><br />
It makes no difference what is written or what anyone has said, if what has been said is in conflict with what the Lord has revealed, we can set it aside. My words, and the teachings of any other member of the Church, high or low, if they do not square with the revelations, we need not accept them. Let us have this matter clear. We have accepted the four standard works as the measuring yardsticks, or balances, by which we measure every man&rsquo;s doctrine. <u>You cannot accept the books written by the authorities of the Church as standards in doctrine, only in so far as they accord with the revealed word in the standard works.</u><br />
