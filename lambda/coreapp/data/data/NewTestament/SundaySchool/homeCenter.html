<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Welcome to the New Testament!<img alt="" src="data/Images/old-and-new-testaments.jpg" style="float:right; height:100px; margin:10px; width:185px" /></strong></p>

<p>This section of the website is designed to assist teachers and individuals in their personal study of the gospel of Jesus Christ. &nbsp;The format is based upon the standard lessons for New Testament Gospel Doctrine as far as the basic area of study. &nbsp;I&#39;ve tried to provide additional insights and commentary on the meaning of the scriptures as taught by the writer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I believe that in many of our Gospel Doctrine classes we only look at the basic information provided in the lessons year by year instead of digging deeper and getting more information from the scriptures. &nbsp;This can sometimes make our lessons stale, and not very interesting.&nbsp; There are many profound truths that can be of benefit to teacher/student. &nbsp;I don&#39;t claim to have found them all :) but I do provide new and additional insights that can be helpful. It is my hope that this information can help improve gospel doctrine lessons, personal scripture study, and help individuals gain a stronger testimony of Jesus Christ through the information herein.<br />

<strong>What is Mormon Doctrine and how is it to be determined?<br />
Mormon Newsroom - <a href="http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/commentary/approaching-mormon-doctrine" target="_blank">article 4 May 2007</a></strong><br />
Not every statement made by a Church leader, past or present, necessarily constitutes doctrine.&nbsp;<br />
Some doctrines are more important than others and might be considered core doctrines.<br />
The mistake that public commentators often make is taking an obscure teaching that is peripheral to the Church&rsquo;s purpose and placing it at the very center.<br />
<br />
<strong>Joseph Fielding Smith clarifies how members need to compare what church leaders teach to the standard works:<br />
â€‹</strong>It makes no difference what is written or what anyone has said, if what has been said is in conflict with what the Lord has revealed, we can set it aside. My words, and the teachings of any other member of the Church, high or low, if they do not square with the revelations, we need not accept them. Let us have this matter clear. We have accepted the four standard works as the measuring yardsticks, or balances, by which we measure every man&rsquo;s doctrine. <u>You cannot accept the books written by the authorities of the Church as standards in doctrine, only in so far as they accord with the revealed word in the standard works.</u><br />
